1 It's such a warm place,
2 But there on the street,
3 Where our footprints are waited for,
4 Stardusted boots
5 Sparkle and shine.
6 Here are the shepherds and upholstered chair,
7 The trigger untouched
8 When it was the right time.
9 Dazzling dreams below the bright sun, orb,
10 My blood type mark is on the sleeve,
11 There's my ordinal number marked on the sleeve,
12 Wish me now some luck in the fight.
